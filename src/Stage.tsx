CURRENTLY PRESENT CHARACTERS (ONLY USE THESE):
${characterInfo}

${absentCharacters.length > 0 ? `CHARACTERS CURRENTLY ABSENT (DO NOT INCLUDE THESE IN DIALOGUE):
${absentCharacters.join(', ')}` : ''}

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
${fullHistory}

New message from User: "${userMessage.content}"

CRITICAL RULES:
1. DO NOT GENERATE ANY USER RESPONSES OR DIALOGUE. The user has already provided their message above.
2. ONLY generate responses from the CURRENTLY PRESENT characters listed above. NEVER speak as the user.
3. DO NOT include absent characters in the dialogue - they are not present in the scene.
4. Characters may reference absent characters but absent characters CANNOT speak or act.
5. ${isAmbientFocused ? 'FOCUS ON THE WORLD AND CHARACTER INTERACTIONS more than on the user\'s message.' : 'Balance responding to the user with character interactions and world activities.'}

WORLD DYNAMICS:
- This is a LIVING WORLD where characters have their own agendas and activities
- Characters should be engaged in their own activities and conversations
- The user is just ONE PARTICIPANT in this world, not the center of attention
- Characters should interact with objects, the environment, and each other
- Include ambient details about the setting, atmosphere, and ongoing activities

NON-DIALOGUE INTERACTIONS:
- Include physical actions, body language, and environmental interactions
- Characters can be doing activities while talking (reading, eating, working, etc.)
- Show characters interacting with objects in the environment
- Include sensory details (sounds, smells, temperature, lighting)
- Characters might be focused on tasks rather than conversation

CHARACTER AUTONOMY:
- Characters should have their own goals and interests independent of the user
- Characters might be in the middle of their own conversations or activities
- Characters might be more interested in each other than in the user
- Characters should have ongoing storylines that progress naturally
- Characters might only briefly acknowledge the user before returning to their activities

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
**{{Character Name}}** *action/state* Their dialogue or non-verbal activity
**{{Another Character}}** *physical interaction with environment* Their response or activity
**{{Third Character}}** *engaged in activity* Their contribution to the scene
[Ensure the scene feels natural with a mix of dialogue and non-dialogue interactions]

IMPORTANT: Create a living scene where ONLY THE PRESENT CHARACTERS (${characterNames.join(", ")}) interact with each other and their environment. Each character must act according to their own personality and current activity. The user should feel like they've walked into an ongoing world that exists independently of them.`;
